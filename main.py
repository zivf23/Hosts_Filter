HostsBlockOnly.py
-----------------

An optimized script that manages content filtering by updating your Windows hosts file.
It:

1. Runs as admin (otherwise can't write to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts).
2. Backs up the existing hosts (if no backup exists).
3. Downloads a blocklist from GitHub (or any URL).
4. Completely replaces any existing blocklist entries with the new ones.
5. Compresses multiple domains into single hosts lines to reduce file size.
6. Uses proper file locking and handles "file in use" errors.
7. Flushes DNS.
8. Logs each step to "HostsBlockLog.txt" and also prints messages to the user.

Usage (after you compile into an .exe or run directly):

1. Right-click -> Run as Administrator (or run in admin shell).
2. The script will do the rest, printing progress and saving logs.

Dependencies:

* Python 3
* pip install requests pywin32
* Windows admin privileges
